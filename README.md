    Crime and injustice are on a constant rise in our community. Personal properties are often damaged or lost as a result. 
We believe technology has a major role to play in solving the problems experienced in the area of law and justice. We think a 
technological approach would best suit this problem for an unlimited number of reasons including:
- The initial cost of implementing of a technological system is not so expensive.
- Software is a very powerful tool and building software is relatively cheap compared to other implementations.
- Software can be reliable and trustworthy and can run on a 24/7 basis without complaining (doesn't get tired).

    In trying to solve this problem, we organised a series of brainstorming session where each member of the team contributed different approaches towards solving this problem. 
After a substantial amount of brainstorming and excessive research on already existing implementations, we agreed on testing the application of such a system with the limited resources we had. 
 
    We concluded that the implementation of this project was very possible and feasible and our team is able to deliver.
